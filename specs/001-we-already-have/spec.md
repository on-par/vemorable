# Feature Specification: VeMorable Core Note-Taking Platform

**Feature Branch**: `001-we-already-have`  
**Created**: 2025-09-09  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "We already have a working base, but VeMorable is a voice/text note taking web application that handles the storage, retrieval, and organization of personal notes via the power of LLMs to help the user not have to think about tagging, folders, etc when storing notes. The LLM will automatically tag, store, and be able to find notes and summarize them for the user at any given time. VeMorable is a note-taking tool to get your ideas out of your head and organized so you don't have to think about where to put them."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a user who captures thoughts and ideas frequently, I need to quickly record notes via voice or text without having to think about where to organize them, so that I can focus on capturing my ideas rather than managing a filing system. The system should automatically organize, tag, and make my notes discoverable through intelligent search and summarization.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I have an idea I want to capture, **When** I record a voice note or type a text note, **Then** the system stores it and automatically determines relevant tags and categories without any manual input from me
2. **Given** I have captured multiple notes over time, **When** I want to find information on a specific topic, **Then** I can search using natural language and the system returns relevant notes even if I didn't use the exact keywords originally
3. **Given** I have accumulated many notes, **When** I ask for a summary of notes on a topic, **Then** the system provides an intelligent summary that synthesizes information across multiple related notes
4. **Given** I'm reviewing my captured notes, **When** I browse my note collection, **Then** I can see them organized by the system's automatic categorization without having created folders or tags myself

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a voice recording is unclear or has poor audio quality?
- How does the system handle notes that don't fit clear categories?
- What occurs when I want to search for something but use very different terminology than what's in my notes?
- How does the system behave when I have duplicate or very similar notes?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow users to create notes via voice recording
- **FR-002**: System MUST allow users to create notes via text input  
- **FR-003**: System MUST automatically generate tags for notes without user intervention
- **FR-004**: System MUST automatically organize notes without requiring user-defined folders or categories
- **FR-005**: System MUST enable users to search for notes using natural language queries
- **FR-006**: System MUST return relevant notes even when search terms don't exactly match note content
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide intelligent summaries of notes on request
- **FR-008**: System MUST persist all notes and their generated metadata
- **FR-009**: System MUST transcribe voice recordings into searchable text [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: accuracy requirements and language support not specified]
- **FR-010**: System MUST process and organize notes automatically [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: processing time expectations not specified]
- **FR-011**: Users MUST be able to access their notes across sessions [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: authentication and user account requirements not specified]
- **FR-012**: System MUST maintain note privacy and security [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific privacy and security requirements not defined]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Note**: Represents a single captured thought or idea, containing the original content (voice or text), transcribed text, automatically generated tags, and metadata like creation timestamp
- **User**: Represents the individual who creates and owns notes, with associated preferences and access permissions
- **Tag**: Represents automatically generated keywords or categories assigned to notes by the system for organization and retrieval
- **Summary**: Represents synthesized information created by combining and analyzing multiple related notes on a topic
